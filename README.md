# Liverfibrosisdetection
Why is Liver Fibrosis Detection Important?
Liver fibrosis is a serious medical condition caused by the excessive buildup of connective tissue in the liver due to chronic damage. Left untreated, it can progress to cirrhosis and even liver failure, significantly impacting patients' lives. Early and accurate detection of liver fibrosis is critical for timely intervention and effective treatment, reducing the burden on patients and healthcare systems.
